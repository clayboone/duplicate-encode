# Duplicate Encode

## A Random Code Challenge

A code challenge (or "kata") found on Codewars that we discussed on Discord.
We decided to play with optimization in different languages.

## Problem Description Transcript

Description:

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each
character in the new string is `"("` if that character appears only once in
the original string, or `")"` if that character appears more than once in the
original string. Ignore capiltalization when determining if a character is a
duplicate.

### Examples

```text
"din"      => "((("
"recede"   => "()()()"
"Success"  => ")())())"
"(( @"     => "))(("
```
